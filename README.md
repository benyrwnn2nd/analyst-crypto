# Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis

This Node.js script analyzes cryptocurrency price data using the Binance API and generates a technical analysis report. It fetches 4-hour candlestick data for a specified cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC) and calculates key technical indicators, including Simple Moving Average (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Retracement Levels, and Swing Highs/Lows. It also detects Golden Cross and Death Cross signals for potential bullish or bearish trends. Additionally, it retrieves a chart image with volume and MACD studies from a TradingView API (`api.chart-img.com`).

## Features

## Example Usage with Chart (Repeated for Clarity)

As requested, hereâ€™s the example usage with chart saving, which is also included in the `README.md`:

```javascript
const { analyst } = require('./index');
const fs = require('fs');

analyst('BTC').then(result => {
  console.log(result.text);
  if (result.chartBuffer) {
    fs.writeFileSync('btc_chart.png', result.chartBuffer);
    console.log('Chart saved as btc_chart.png');
  }
}).catch(err => {
  console.error('Error:', err);
});
```
